Flux is an open-source digital twin for chlor-alkali electrolysis plants, modeling multi-electrolyzer operations to optimize energy use, predict membrane degradation, and improve efficiency. Built with Rust, Python, GlassFlow, and ClickHouse, it ingests high-frequency sensor data to deliver real-time KPIs, predictive maintenance, and process optimization.
