**Go** is a modern, open-source, statically-typed programming language created by Google. Designed with simplicity, efficiency, and concurrency in mind, Go runs seamlessly across multiple platforms, including [Linux](https://pabloagn.com/categories/linux/), macOS, Windows, and FreeBSD. Over the years, Go has been steadily gaining popularity thanks to its robust standard library, strong tooling, and thriving open-source ecosystem.

In this Blog Article, we'll explore Go’s main features, why it’s valuable for developers, compare it to other widely-used programming languages such as Java, Python, and Rust, and wrap up with resources for those looking to master Go.

We’ll be working with Go examples that can be found in the [Blog Article Repo](https://github.com/pabloagn/blog/tree/master/computer-science/go-for-developers).
