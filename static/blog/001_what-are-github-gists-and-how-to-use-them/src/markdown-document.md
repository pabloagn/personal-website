# Markdown
## A brief introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for creating formatted text. It was created in 2004 by John Gruber & Aaron Swartz and has been widely adopted by various document-creation software applications. Markdown accepts basic markup syntax; depending on the application used, it also supports extended syntax for more advanced formatting.

### Markdown supports multiple elements such as:
- Headers from H1 up to H6
- Paragraph body
- Unordered lists
- Ordered lists
- Inline code

- Many other elements

### Markdown is amazing
We could keep on mentioning Markdown capabilities, but we would not end.
Instead, we can consult the [Markdown Documentation](https://github.com/pabloagn/documentation/blob/master/writing-and-formatting/markdown.md#markdown) which includes all of the beforementioned, plus more.
